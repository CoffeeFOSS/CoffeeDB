In the `Frontend` directory, run `ng serve --watch`

## Back End

In the `Backend` directory, run `dotnet watch`

Most changes to backend does not refresh via `dotnet watch`, so you'll need to restart the backend often.

## Dev QoL

If you are using VSCode, please install the workspace extensions in `.vscode/extensions`.

Postman collection files will be updated in `misc/postman`, later on we'll add proper API documentation.
